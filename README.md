Fast HTML template generator

> http://sanusart.github.io/html-now

### What's this?

This will assist you to create very basic HTML template for your page/application as a fast start point. Nothing fancy here, it will only allow you to choose and add scripts or styles.

### How it works

There are few settings in the tabs on the left which will allow you to perform simple additions to the template that you see in front of you.

### Made using...

This was made using [AngularJs](https://angularjs.org/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [Bower](http://bower.io/), [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and [Font-awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
